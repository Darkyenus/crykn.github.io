# gdx-showcase

This repo is a community effort to try to bring the libGDX site up to date and make it representative of what libGDX is capable of. The deployed page can be found **[here](https://crykn.github.io/).**

## Contributing
If you want to collaborate, you first need to clone this repo.

### How do gh-pages work?
This page is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) blog, hosted via GitHub Pages. All **pages** and **posts**  need to have a YAML frontmatter, for example this one:

```
---
permalink: /best_url_path_4_ever/
title: "Super Nice Page Title"
---
```

After this frontmatter, everything can be written in **markdown**. Github offers a very concise explanation on how one can add posts and pages: https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/adding-content-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll

The minimal mistakes theme, that is used here, also supports some nice features ([galleries](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/helpers/#gallery), [header images](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/layouts/#header-overlay), [tables of content](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/layouts/#table-of-contents)), which are detailed here: https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-sb
